# phase_3_project
The goal of this project is to practice and reinforce the essential Machine Learning concepts learned in phase 3 of the Flatiron School curriculum. To achieve this, a GitHub Repository and a Jupyter Notebook will be created with code and notes, and a presentation will be given.

The project will cover important topics such as cleaning and exploring data, creating features, selecting and evaluating models, and using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

The project will conclude with a report that summarizes the key insights, challenges encountered, and lessons learned.
